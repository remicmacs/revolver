Revolver (short for *Revolution Versioning*) is a versioning scheme inspired by [CalDev]. It uses a date and time as versioning numbers but it uses the [French Republican Calendar] (also called the revolutionary calendar in France) for the date with the [Holocene Calendar] for the year, and the [Decimal time] for the time.

## Scheme

Revolver introduces a simple versioning convention :

```
YYYYY[.MM[.DD[-HMM]]]
```

* YYYYY - (12019, 12020, ...) - Year in the [Holocene Calendar], or the current year in the [Gregorian Calendar] plus 10 000
* MM - (01-12) - Month in the [French Republican Calendar]
* DD - (01-30) - Day in the [French Republican Calendar]
* H - (0-9) - Hour in [Decimal time]
* MM - (00-99) - Minutes in [Decimal Time]

The format allows flexible release cycles by omitting one or more part. For example, if you plan to release hourly, you may opt for the full `YYYYY.MM.DD-HMM` but if you plan to release monthy, you could opt for the much simpler `YYYYY.MM`.

### Can I release quarterly and add the quarter in the version number ?

What are you ? A [multi-million euros company] ? No, this versioning scheme does not plan to implement quarters in the version number.

## API

### now

Returns a version number corresponding to the current time in the format `YYYYY.MM.DD-HMM`.

### from_iso

Takes a string in the format of [ISO 8601]. Returns a version number in the format `YYYYY.MM.DD-HMM`.
